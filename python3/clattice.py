"""
Project: slatt
Package: clattice for 0.2.4 on top of our own closure miner
Programmers: JLB

Purpose: implement a lattice by lists of antecedents among closed itsets

Offers:
.hist_cuts: all cuts computed so far, so that they are not recomputed
.dump_hist_cuts
.computing closure op
.to string method
.scale in closminer serves to use ints instead of floats for
  support/confidence/boost bounds, and allows us to index
  already-computed bases or cuts - params moved there:
  scale, univ, nrtr, nrits, nrocc, U (univ set), card (number of closures),
  maximum and minimum supports seen (absolute integers),
  supp_percent (float in [0,100] actually used for the mining)

ToDo:
.check whether the skipping of closures in computing cuts works at all
.refactor the handling of omitted nodes in setcuts:
  the conf boost (upper width) bound and the variants of Kr Property 9
  should be treated in the same manner
.raise a more appropriate exception if platform not handled
.recover the handling of mns/mxs and check their use in extreme cases
.if mxs zero, option is conservative estimate minsupp-1
.is it possible to save time somehow using immpreds to compute mxn/mns?
.rethink the scale, now 100000 means three decimal places for percentages
.be able to load only a part of the closures in the available file if desired support is higher than in the file
.review the ticking rates
.should become a set of closures?
