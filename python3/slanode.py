"""
Programmers: JLB, DGP

Purpose: implementing lattice nodes and other itemset usages such as generators

Inherits from frozenset and Structure so that they can index dictionaries and
the attributes are set in a special attribute called _fields.
__init__ method takes any possible iterable.

Offers:
.supp, card
..mxs (max supp of a subset)
..mns (min supp of a superset)
..gmxs (max supp of a minimal generator that reaches some conf thr to the node)
.revise() to change the contents of the slanode while preserving the mxs/mns values - returns a new slanode
.package contributes ops outside class:
..str2node to make a slanode by parsing a line like the Borgelt output
.auxitset(string-or-another-iterable), auxiliary class to parse into set and support
..then coerce into slanode the auxitset and call setsupp(supp)

Notes:
.supp is an integer, absolute support; dataset size needed to compute relative support
.may want to use customized separator character to read the support from the apriori output ('/' or ';' or...)
.copy method is not necessary, because there exists a method deepcopy from the module
 copy.

ToDo:
.add initialization for output from other closure miners such as Zaki's RULES
.some day the contents should be able to accommodate trees and sequences and...
